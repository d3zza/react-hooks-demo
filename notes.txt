switch out components with counter an % on App

LifeCycle / Cleanup
add a listener to something outside of react's control e.g document

MouseMove listener. Will get scope error on callback so introduce binding

Update App.tsx to toggle between components so we can show them being unloaded.

Show error that we get if mouse move is not removed
